           Pro Tools was developed under the brand name Sound Designer in 1984 by two UC Berkely Graduates Evan Brookes and Peter Gotcher.
           Sound Designer's original purpose was to edit sounds for the E-mu Emulator sampling keyboard. Brookes developed universal file specification which allowed Sound Designer files to be tranferred from many different keyboard manufactures.
           Now Pro Tools is known as the industry standard for audio production all over the world. ProTools was developed in C, C++, and Assembly Language. These languages are used because they are lower level programing languages so they are able
           process the audio quickly.
