              The first version of FruityLoops was created by Didier Dambrin. It was created for the company
              Imagine-Line in 1998. The 1998 verssion of FruityLoops was a four channel MIDI drum machine. 
              By 1999 Live recording was added and the Digital Audio Workstation was created. In 2003 the name changed
              from FruityLoops to FL studio to make people look at the software in a more serious way. FL studio is a very
              popular DAW used in many productions but mainly in Hip-Hop. FL studio was developed in Delphi which is an event 
              driven language. Delphi was used because its speed is superb. It has been said that Delphi could compile 170,000 
              lines per second. This speed is very important for Digital signal processing.
