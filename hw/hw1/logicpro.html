                 The beginings of Logic Pro started in the mid to late 1980's. 
                 Gerhard Lengeling and Chris Adam developed a MIDI sequencer which was a pattern based 
                 sequencer. During the time most MIDI sequencers presented a song as a linear set of tracks.
                 Eventually track-based sequencing overtook pattern-based sequencing. The C-lab programmers
                 left that company to form Emagic which in 1993 released Notator Logic. Notator Logic attempted to put together 
                 track-based and pattern-based operation. Apple aquired Emagic in 2002 and the rest is history.
                 Logic was developed in C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift. They used these languages for speed within the program.
                 Swift was used because logic is only available on Apple products.
